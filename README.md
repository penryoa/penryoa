## Hey There! ðŸ˜Š

### Who Am I?
I'm Addi (she/her), a software developer currently based in NC. I like collecting hobbies and experiences, like skydiving, motorcycle riding, language learning, etc etc. If you can't get enough and want to know more, I'd recommend [checking my website](http://thecalmplexcoder.com), or since you're already here, the [code for my website](https://github.com/penryoa/Website)!

### My Experience (In A Few Points)
#### ðŸŒ¸ Full Stack Software Developer for 4 years in a private fintech company ðŸŒ¸
- Converted legacy PHP code to a microservices architecture via web applications using Python, JavaScript (React, Redux, Tailwind), and both NoSQL (AWS DynamoDB) and SQL (MySQL) databases
- Led the development of a suite of web applications; i.e. requirements gathering, UI / UX design, data architecture, development, mentoring, leading standups / meetings, so on.
- Wrote and utilized APIs focused on: (a) transferring data from in-house web applications to databases; (b) handling information from partner companies; (c) autofilling information like addresses via Google API.

#### ðŸŒ¸ Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Student for 4 years, which yes, I am absolutely making its own bullet point ðŸŒ¸
- Learned about: software patterns; SQL / NoSQL data design and visualization; other core principles of software and hardware design (i.e. a silly little thing I found interesting is that as we make memory more compact, the issue becomes keeping the hardware itself cool)
- Wrote my own parsing language
- Made a dating app for dads using Java and MySQL (called Dumble, Dad + Bumble)
- A hardware deepdive of the GameCube
- Made a Java application that parses Java files and outputs a string that represents an accurate UML diagram (to practice identifying software patterns)
- ... do I need to go on lol? This place was intense, but I learned so much and sometimes even had fun doing it.

### Navigating The Repositories
There are not as many repos as I'd like there to be, and they're mostly not up-to-date with my skills. So I'll at least point out the more interesting examples.

#### 1. 2020 - Current | [My Personal Website](https://github.com/penryoa/Website)
As its README says, it's personal and hosted on my own Raspberry Pi. It's not meant to wow you with professionalism, but it's a fun, simple project I like to periodically update.

#### 2. 2019 | [A Java UML Generator](https://github.com/penryoa/rose-hulman_backup/tree/csse374-software_design)
This the project mentioned above that creates a string representing a UML diagram of some given Java files, especially meant to identify different software patterns.

#### 3. 2019 | [Parallel Computing in C](https://github.com/penryoa/rose-hulman_backup/tree/csse335-parallel_computing) _(not a jazz song title)_
I wanted to include something different, though the repo itself isn't the most straightforward. This is from my parallel computing class where everything was written in C. I thought it'd be fun to throw in a low level coding language, and with this repo specifically, I'd recommend checking the PDF files in each folder to see what the assignment was if you're curious.

### Projects On The Horizon

#### 1. Language Output Generator (LOG)
An application that generates an assignment to work on in another language (catchy tagline TBD). This is my brainchild of a project that I want to see in the world. Currently in the requirements and design process, but [feel free to snoop on the design docs!](https://www.figma.com/file/tJYSeV3GA4ECbXn6oVzAUV/Project-Documentation-(Product-Management)?type=whiteboard&node-id=1%3A131&t=ja86isBgm6MZNVX8-1) And it's getting the full Product Manager and Software Developer treatment, mind you.

#### 2. (Ongoing) Update Website
Like I've said, it could just use some TLC and embellishment, but I do try to update chunks of it at a time.
