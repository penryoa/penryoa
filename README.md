# Welcome! (:

I'm Addi (she/her), a software developer currently based in NC. I like collecting hobbies and experiences like skydiving, language learning, motorcycle riding, etc etc. If you can't get enough and want to know more, I'd recommend [checking my website](http://thecalmplexcoder.com), or since you're already here, the [code for my website](https://github.com/penryoa/Website)!


## My Experience (In A Few Points)
### ðŸŒ¸ Full Stack Software Developer for 4 years in a private fintech company ðŸŒ¸
- Converted legacy PHP code to a microservices architecture via web applications using Python, JavaScript (React, Redux, Tailwind), and both NoSQL (AWS DynamoDB) and SQL (MySQL) databases
- Led the development of a suite of web applications; i.e. requirements gathering, UI / UX design, data architecture, development, mentoring, leading standups / meetings, so on.
- Wrote and utilized APIs focused on: (a) transferring data from in-house web applications to databases; (b) handling information from partner companies; (c) autofilling information like addresses via Google API.

### ðŸŒ¸ Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Student for 4 years ðŸŒ¸
- Learned about: software patterns; SQL / NoSQL data design and visualization; writing software requirements; project management; other core principles of software and hardware design (i.e. a silly little thing I found interesting is that as we make memory more compact, the issue becomes keeping the hardware itself cool)
- Wrote my own parser using Scheme
- Made a dating app for dads using Java and MySQL
- Did a hardware deepdive of the GameCube
- Made a Java application that parses Java files and outputs a string that represents an accurate UML diagram (to practice identifying software patterns)
- ... do I need to go on lol? This place was intense, but I learned so much and sometimes even had fun doing it.

## What I'm Up To Right Now

### 1. 2020 - Current | [My Personal Website](https://github.com/penryoa/Website)
My personal website could just use some TLC and embellishment - and better adherement to good software engineering principles - so I try to update chunks of it at a time.

### 2. 2024 - Current [Language Output Generator (LOG)](https://github.com/Language-Output-Generator)
An application that generates an assignment to work on in another language and much more (catchy tagline TBD). This is my brainchild of a project that I want to see in the world. Currently in early development and finalizing design.



## Additional Repos
A lot of the code I have to share is from university and only held here for posterity's sake. That being said, I can point out a few interesting examples from coursework.

### 1. 2019 | [A Java UML Generator](https://github.com/penryoa/rose-hulman_backup/tree/csse374-software_design)
This the project mentioned above that creates a string representing a UML diagram of some given Java files, especially meant to identify different software patterns.

### 2. 2019 | [Parallel Computing in C](https://github.com/penryoa/rose-hulman_backup/tree/csse335-parallel_computing) _(not a jazz song title)_
I wanted to include something different, though the repo itself isn't the most straightforward. This is from my parallel computing class where everything was written in C. I thought it'd be fun to throw in a low level coding language, and with this repo specifically, I'd recommend checking the PDF files in each folder to see what the assignment was if you're curious.
